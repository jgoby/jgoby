Hi, I’m Jeff Goby currently in the state of Oregon.

I already have experience in C++, R, and VBA in Excel. I’m currently learning Python, and will branch out to other languages later. 

I’m interested in coding for all things environmental, but primarily enabling the transition to reliable cost-effective renewable energy, electrification, and energy efficiency through building tools for energy assessment and system control/monitoring. Other interests include building remote sensing tools for improved natural resource management. 

I’m looking to collaborate on any projects touching these areas. Feel free to reach me at jgoby@hotmail.com.
